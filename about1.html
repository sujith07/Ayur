<p align="justify"><b>Ffe (ayu) is the combination (samyoga) of body, senses, mind and reincarnating soul. 
Ayurveda is the most sacred science of life, beneficial to humans both in this world and the world beyond."
—Charaka Samhita, Sutrasthana, 1.42-43.
Ayurveda is the oldest surviving complete medical system in the world. Derived from its ancient Sanskrit roots - 'ayus' (life) and 'ved' (knowledge) – and offering a rich, comprehensive outlook to a healthy life, its origins go back nearly 5000 years.</p>
<br>
<p>Ayurveda is not simply a health care system but a form of lifestyle adopted to maintain perfect balance and harmony within the human existence, from the most abstract transcendental values to the most concrete physiological expressions.</p><br> 

<p>Based on the premise that life represents an intelligent co-ordination of the Atma (Soul), Mana (Mind), Indriya (Senses) and Sharira (Body). That revolves around the five dense elements that go into the making of the constitution of each individual, called Prakriti. Which in turn is determined by the vital balance of the three physical energies - Vata, Pitta, Kapha and the three mental energies - Satwa, Rajas, Tamas. 

In the modern fast lane era, the health and happiness has become a very complex phenomenon. It is here the strength of Ayurveda is being recognized as a medium to rejuvenate the innate power within ourselves. Drawing from a rich understanding of an individual's psycho-physiological state, Ayurveda tailors a unique treatment that suits the patient's basic requirements.</p><br>
